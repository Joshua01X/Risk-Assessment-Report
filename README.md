# Risk-Assessment-Report

## Scenario
You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future.

After inspecting the organization’s network, you discovered four major vulnerabilities:

- Employees share passwords.
- The admin password for the database is set to the default.
- The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
- Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used.

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future.

### Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

After analyzing the four major vulnerabilities, it is clear that the organization needs better measures to maintain their security, particularly regarding password management. Hence, it is recommended to:
1. Enforce a stricter password security management system.
2. Implement frequent password changes.
3. Utilize NGFWs (Next-Generation Firewalls) for better protection, especially in filtering external network traffic.

### Part 2: Explain your recommendations

The need for a tighter and better password security system is evident, as most major vulnerabilities found after the inspection were related to outdated password management practices. This recommendation highlights the necessity for employees to avoid sharing passwords, as this can allow easy access to each other’s accounts and data. Additionally, using default admin passwords increases vulnerability.

This concern aligns with the next recommendation: implementing frequent password changes. While passwords are essential for securing assets, they alone are not enough. Frequent password changes ensure that previous passwords become obsolete, providing increased protection against brute-force attacks.

Lastly, implementing NGFWs (Next-Generation Firewalls) is crucial. NGFWs are essential for large social media organizations and offer functionalities such as port filtering, deep packet inspection, anomaly monitoring, and proactive countermeasures. These capabilities help maintain and ensure a strong overall security posture, enabling the organization to operate securely.
